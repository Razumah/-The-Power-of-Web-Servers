      <h2>Web Servers Today</h2>
      <p>The web servers we have today are more powerful than you can ever think of, and
they are also more adaptable. Because of its ability to be so dependable, Apache
continues to be a popular option for companies and everyday users for things like
building tiny websites or even personal projects. Nginx, LiteSpeed, and IIS provide scalable and secure services for millions of users worldwide. They support dynamic content and modern frameworks. This evolution was
molded by technologies like Apache, Nginx, Microsoft IIS, and LiteSpeed, which are
supported by devoted businesses and fervent communities. Web servers seem to
have a bright future thanks to advancements in the cloud, edge technology, AI, and
sustainability. </p>
