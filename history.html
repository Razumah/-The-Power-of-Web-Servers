      <h2>Origins</h2>
      <p>The first web server was created in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. It was called HTTPD and ran on NeXT computers. As the world began to become more equipped with such technology, the web grew
globally, not only in European countries, and continued to grow in demand
everywhere. The first ever server software was called HTTPD, and this was created
by none other than Tim Berners-Lee. It was also able to run on (NeXT) computers. This allowed people to access the web every day by simply opening HTML pages. It
genuinely marked the beginning of a new era in data exchange, and I believe it
should be celebrated more; the web server was originally exclusive to CERN. One of
the most important also came in 1995 with the launch of the Apache HTTP Server. When Microsoft launched Internet Information Services (IIS), a web server course, in
1996, IIS was designed to work perfectly with Windows servers and found its home
in companies and organizations that were already using Microsoft products. This
gave a strong option for Apache, mainly for companies wanting a Windows
environment that was fully integrated</p>
